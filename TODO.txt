The tracker database can be accesed via a http REST interface,
separate from the tracker interface.

GET /torrents/<InfoHash>/complete
{complete:12345}

GET /torrents/<InfoHash>/incomplete
{incomplete:53214}

GET /torrents/<InfoHash>/downloaded
{downloaded:459}

GET /torrents/<InfoHash>/
{complete:12345, incomplete:53214, downloaded:459}


Architecture

-	tracker_http - front service implementing the http tracker api as per
	http://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification.
	
	It handles two kind of requests:
	
	/announce?info_hash=<tracked_torrent>&peer_id=<client id>&<...>
		A bittorrent client will hit this url to 
			- update the tracker view of client status in relation to tracked_torrent
			- ask for updated stats about tracked_torrent
			- ask for a list of peers
		
		The three operations are managed independently.
			
			-	a global event {announce, Peer} is raised. Installed
				event handlers could use this data to update a database.
			
			-	torrent_stats service is asked complete/incomplete count for
				tracked_torrent
				
			-	torrent_peers service is asked to produce
				a list of peers in binary format
								
	/scrape
